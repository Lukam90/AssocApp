# Résumé du projet en anglais 

The project consists of a table reservation system for exhibitors at an annual fair organized by an association of postcard collectors based in Alsace.

Before, the reservations and the treasury were managed manually.

It was the same for sending letters, announcing an upcoming fair and news from the association.

An exhibitor can register with his e-mail address and a password if he or she wishes.

He can then make a reservation request.

If necessary, the treasurer or the administrator registers the exhibitor manually with the essential information (e.g. first and family names, label).

The reservation is then validated according to the payment status and the number of tables available.
